# COVID-19 Global Trends Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves building a data analysis and reporting notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends. It analyzes cases, deaths, and vaccinations across various countries and over time, using real-world data from Our World in Data. The primary output is a Jupyter Notebook that includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and narrative insights.

## Objectives of the Project

*   Import and clean the "Our World in Data" COVID-19 global dataset.
*   Analyze time-based trends for key metrics: total cases, total deaths, new cases, and vaccinations.
*   Compare these metrics across selected countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India, UK, Brazil, South Africa).
*   Visualize trends using various charts (line, bar) and geographical maps (choropleth).
*   Communicate findings, insights, and patterns observed in the data through a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

## Tools and Libraries Used

*   **Python 3.x**
*   **Jupyter Notebook** (for interactive development and reporting)
*   **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
*   **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
*   **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For static data visualizations (line charts, bar charts).
*   **Plotly Express:** For interactive data visualizations, particularly choropleth maps.
*   **Git & GitHub:** For version control and project sharing.

## Data Source

*   **Dataset:** `owid-covid-data.csv`
*   **Source:** Our World in Data - COVID-19 Dataset
*   **Direct Link (to data folder):** [https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
*   **Specific File Used:** `owid-covid-data.csv` from the link above.

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/covid-19-global-analysis.git
    cd covid-19-global-analysis
    ```
2.  **Set up a Python Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file can be created using `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing packages. For now, manual installation:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly jupyterlab
    ```
4.  **Download the Data (if not included in the repo):**
    Download `owid-covid-data.csv` from the [Our World in Data GitHub repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/raw/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv) and place it in the project's root directory. *(Note: If you've included the CSV in your GitHub repo, this step is not needed by users unless they want the absolute latest version).*
5.  **Launch Jupyter Notebook/Lab:**
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    # or
    # jupyter notebook
    ```
6.  Open the `covid_19_global_trends_analysis.ipynb` file from the Jupyter interface.
7.  Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Insights & Reflections

*(Summarize 3-5 key findings from your notebook's "Insights & Reporting" section here. Below are examples based on the notebook structure provided earlier)*

1.  **Diverse Pandemic Trajectories:** Different countries experienced distinct pandemic waves at varied times and magnitudes, clearly visualized in the time-series plots for cases and deaths.
2.  **Vaccination Rollout Disparities:** There was a significant variation in the speed and extent of vaccination rollouts across the analyzed countries and globally, as shown by vaccination progress charts and the choropleth map.
3.  **Utility of Data Normalization:** Metrics like 'cases per million' and 'percentage of population vaccinated' provide a more equitable comparison between countries than absolute numbers, crucial for understanding relative impact and response.
4.  **Data Smoothing for Clarity:** Applying a 7-day rolling average to daily new cases helped in discerning underlying trends by smoothing out reporting anomalies.
5.  **Geospatial Visualization Power:** Choropleth maps offered an intuitive way to grasp the geographical distribution of cases and vaccination coverage at a glance.

**Reflections:**
*   Working with real-world messy data requires careful cleaning and preprocessing.
*   Choosing appropriate visualizations is key to conveying insights effectively.
*   The OWID dataset is incredibly rich and allows for many more avenues of exploration beyond this project's scope (e.g., impact of variants, correlation with socio-economic factors).
*   Understanding the context behind the data (e.g., changes in testing strategies, reporting delays) is important for accurate interpretation.
